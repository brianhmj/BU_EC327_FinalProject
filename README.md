## QUESTIONS FROM PARKER

I'm working on finding a way to store event/appointment data. I was thinking that I would try to set up the information so that it could trigger a new window to open when an appointment was coming up.

Does this sound okay with you guys? Too much?
- I was thinking that I would create a method to create a window when an appointment is coming up
- I think it would make the most sense to load the stored appointments from main each time.

I'll keep checking this file and keep an eye on the group chat.
